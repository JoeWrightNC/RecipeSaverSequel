# RecipeSaver
Full Stack Application using Node.JS, Express, MySQL, HandleBars, Materialize and a homemade ORM utilizing the MVC design pattern.

## Description

This simple full stack application utilizes a front end constructed via HTML templating (Handlebars) and the Materialize CSS library while implementing a back end made with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

The user may add any recipe name and url where they've found the recipe online to the persistent database via an entry form.  The recipe will then be stored on the "Recipes To Try" page, where the user can either save the recipe or delete it.  If saved, the tried status in the database will be updated and the recipe will then be rendered on the saved recipes page.  If deleted, the record will no longer be shown.
